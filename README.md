Code for  "Did P51 Destory Luftwaffe?" Post

I have two folders each with a similar layout: both have a dataset folder and a code part. These produce charts that get placed in the images folder. 

A regression analysis is also included that uses data from both Luftwaffe and Eighth Air Force Data. 

This was more of a side project so code might be a bit messy. If you have any questions please reach out and I'll do my best to help.
